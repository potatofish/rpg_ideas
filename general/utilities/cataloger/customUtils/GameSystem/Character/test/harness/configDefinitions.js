// Players make Characters for a System during a Session
//Character Design Principles for testing
// #1 - Characters (config) is defined by System
// #2 - Characters are created by & belong to Players
// #3 - Characters are created during Sessions 
// #4 - Characters are related through Setting
// #1 - Characters (config) is defined by System
// -> A Character config inspired by Fiasco (a game System)
//console.log("****Config****");
