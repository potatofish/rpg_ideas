Failure to make the total indicated above results in the source having full effect. 

Examples:

* turned to stone,
* full damage from dragon's breath
* etc

Scoring the total indicated above (or scoring higher) means the weapon has no effect (death ray, polymorph, paralization, stone, or spell) or one-half effect

(poison scoring one-half of the total possible hit damage and dragon's breath
scoring one-half of its full damage). Wands of cold, fire balls, lightning, etc. and
staves are treated as indicated, but saving throws being made result in one-half
damage.
